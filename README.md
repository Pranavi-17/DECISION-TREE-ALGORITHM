# Problem Statement:
### In the era of smartphones, understanding the factors that influence the decision to purchase an iPhone is crucial for businesses and marketers. This project aims to create a predictive model that determines the likelihood of an individual purchasing an iPhone based on their gender, age, and salary. The dataset consists of individuals' demographic information (gender and age) and financial status (salary), along with a binary variable indicating whether they purchased an iPhone (1 for "yes" and 0 for "no").

### Overall, this project seeks to develop a predictive model that can assist businesses in identifying potential iPhone buyers based on their demographic and financial information, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies and product offerings
